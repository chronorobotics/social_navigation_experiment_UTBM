# UTBM social-aware navigation experiment

To efficiently operate in human-populated environments, mobile robots benefit from the use of models that represent not only the environment structure but also human behaviour.
One class of these models aims to capture the observed spatial and temporal layout of pedestrian flows to make this knowledge available to improve the way the robots move around humans.
We present a new benchmarking methodology of spatio-temporal models not in terms of model quality alone but rather in terms of the afforded socially-compliant navigation of mobile robots in human-populated environments.
While previous attempts to evaluate the pedestrian flow models were solely aimed at their predictive capabilities, we assess the models by their ability to support socially-compliant path planning.
In particular, we use the models to plan robot trajectories through the environment, and then we count how many times a robot had to change its plan to prevent a collision.
Using the aforementioned methodology and datasets gathered continuously for several weeks, we compare several state-of-the-art pedestrian flow models.
